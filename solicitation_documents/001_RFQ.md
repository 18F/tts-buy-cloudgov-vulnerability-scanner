This RFQ is issued under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

Your company, along with other Nessus Manager authorized resellers, is being requested to provide a competitive price quote to upgrade the current cloud.gov Nessus Manager License, CID #29905.
 
By submission of its quote, the vendor accepts all RFQ requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements in the [Scope of Work (Attachment 1)](002_SOW.md).

This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with [FAR 13.106-2](https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/html/Subpart%2013_1.html#wp1125487). This is a competitive LPTA source selection in which price is considered the most important factor. By submission of its quote, the vendor accepts all RFQ requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable vendors, shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in a quote being determined technically unacceptable. Vendors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The Government intends to select ONE contractor for award of this requirement. 

For the purpose of award, the government shall evaluate quotes based on the evaluation factors described below:

## FACTOR 1: Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)
Provide a quote for the Nessus Manager license upgrade from the current 128-host/agent license to the a 512-host/agent license. 

## FACTOR 2: Cost/Price
The vendor shall submit the total Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), including the cost of software license(s) and any other items necessary to upgrade from the current 128-host/agent license to the a 512-host/agent license, using the format below. 

The price shall be broken out to show all costs for the one Base Year and 2 Option Years.  The Government will not make an award of the purchase order until such time as the price quotation received is determined to be fair and reasonable, and award of the contract is in the best interest of the Government.

The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price, or are unbalanced, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the technical requirements.
