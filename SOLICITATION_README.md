## Background

As part of its Authorization to Operate (ATO), [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) (TTS) has to purchase access to a pre-existing, commercially available, and specific vulnerability scanner that will allow it to continuously monitor its infrastructure. Having outgrown a license that could be purchased on a Purchase Card (p-card), the purpose of this acquisition is to give [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) a license that will allow it to monitor the larger number of hosts/agents now required to be scanned.

### What we're hoping to end up with
