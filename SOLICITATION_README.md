## Background

To fulfill requirements for its Authority to Operate (ATO), the [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) team at TTS needs access to a pre-existing, commercially available, and specific vulnerability scanner as part of continuously monitoring its infrastructure. cloud.gov previously had a license that could be purchased on a Purchase Card (p-card), but had outgrown that license. The purpose of this acquisition was to give [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) a larger license that would allow it to monitor the larger number of hosts/agents now required to be scanned.

### What we're hoping to end up with

The purpose of this solicitation is for the contractor to deliver a license which cloud.gov will utilize to scan up to 512 hosts/agents. The contractor will provide access to the Tenable Nessus Manager vulnerability scanner license via a URL.
