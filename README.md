# cloud.gov Vulnerability Scanner

This repository was created in the hopes that government agencies -- from Federal to state to local municipalities -- can make an acquisition of a vulnerability scanner license simpler. We have included our internal [acquisition documents](acquisition_documents) as well as our public facing [solicitation documents](solicitation_documents). The [README](SOLICITATION_README.md) file associated with the solicitation itself is also included.

## Background

As part of its Authorization to Operate (ATO), [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) (TTS) had to purchase access to a pre-existing, commercially available, and specific vulnerability scanner that will allow it to continuously monitor its infrastructure. Having outgrown a license that could be purchased on a Purchase Card (p-card), the purpose of this acquisition was to give [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) a license that would allow it to monitor the larger number of hosts/agents now required to be scanned.

### What we're hoping to end up with

The purpose of this repository is to provide government agencies (and even private industry partners) the ability to learn from our experiences and acquire this specific vulnerability scanner for themselves.
